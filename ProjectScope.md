*Three functions of Project Scope:* 
**Time, Cost, Quality**

Minimum viable product: Enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future development. 
# Managing Scope
- A requirement baseline is an itemized set of features intended to be delivered in a specific version of an application.
- Priority
- Effore (time-learned skill)
- Risk
- Always engage customers. 
- Scope/Change negotiation
    - Start high, but reasonable 
    - Separate people from problem
    - Focus on change, not position
    - Understand walk-away point
    - Invent options for mutual gain.
    - Apply objective criteria
- have an official change process. 
# Requirements Management
- Risk mitigation (Requirements related risks)

## Four principles of requirements management
- Interactive, face-to-face communication is cheapest/fastest channel for information exchange.
- Excess methodology is costly.
- Large teams need heavier methodology.
- Greater ceremony is appropriate for more critical/risk projects.

## Change management tools and skills
- Baseline
- Establish sigle channel to control change.
- Use Change control system.
- Manage change hierarchically. (Traceability)
- Audit changes.

Non-Functional Requirements: used to judge the operations of a system rather than specific requirements. 

## Mastering non-functional requirements.
- The constraints and requirements for the IT system.
- Input for estimation of cost and system sizing.
- Input for the architecture and design of the model. 
- Infput for the design phase: performance, scalabiliyt, availability.
- There are many, many types of NFRs.
